              In this article, we cover the absolute basics of HTML. To get you started, this article defines 
              elements, attributes, and all the other important terms you may have heard. It also explains 
              where these fit into HTML. You will learn how HTML elements are structured, how a typical HTML 
              page is structured, and other important basic language features. Along the way, there will be an 
              opportunity to play with HTML too!

            <p>
              HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure 
              the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to 
              be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different 
              parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content 
              into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider 
              the following line of text:
            </p>
            <code>
              My cat is very grumpy
            </code>
            <p>
              If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it 
              in a paragraph (<code class="inline">&lt;p&gt;</code>) element:
            </p>
            <code>
              &lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;
            </code>

            <p>
              The anatomy of our element is:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">The opening tag:</span> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p 
                for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the 
                element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the 
                paragraph text.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">The content:</span> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the 
                paragraph text.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">The closing tag:</span> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes 
                a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include 
                a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>

          <article>
            <p>
              The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is 
              loaded. It contains information such as the page <code class="inline">&lt;title&gt;</code>, links 
              to CSS (if you choose to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and other 
              metadata (data about the HTML, such as the author, and important keywords that describe the 
              document.) Web browsers use information contained in the head to render the HTML document 
              correctly. In this article we'll cover all of the above and more, in order to give you a good 
              basis for working with markup.

            </code>
            <p>
              The HTML head is the contents of the <code class="inline">&lt;head&gt;</code> element â€” unlike the 
              contents of the <code class="inline">&lt;body&gt;</code> element (which are displayed on the page 
              when loaded in a browser), the head's content is not displayed on the page. Instead, the head's 
              job is to contain metadata about the document. In the above example, the head is quite small:
            </p>
            <code>
              <span class=new-line>&lt;head&gt;</span>
              <span class=new-line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;</span>
              <span class=new-line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;</span>
              <span class=new-line>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
            </code>
            <p>
              In larger pages however, the head can get quite large. Try going to some of your favorite websites 
              and use the developer tools to check out their head contents. Our aim here is not to show you how 
              to use everything that can possibly be put in the head, but rather to teach you how to use the 
              major elements that you'll want to include in the head, and give you some familiarity. Let's get 
              started.

          <article>
            <p>
              We've already seen the <code class="inline">&lt;title&gt;</code> element in action â€” this can be 
              used to add a title to the document. This however can get confused with the 
              <code class="inline">&lt;h1&gt;</code> element, which is used to add a top level heading to your 
              body content â€” this is also sometimes referred to as the page title. But they are different things! 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The <code class="inline">&lt;h1&gt;</code> element appears on the page when loaded in the browser â€” 
                generally this should be used once per page, to mark up the title of your page content (the story 
                title, or news headline, or whatever is appropriate to your usage).
              </li>
              <li>
                The <code class="inline">&lt;title&gt;</code> element is metadata that represents the title of the 
                overall HTML document (not the document's content).

            <p>
              One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser can display an HTML document 
              the way its developer intends. This article explains the way HTML can be used to structure a page 
              of text by adding headings and paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating lists, and more.

          <article>
            <p>
              Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a 
              newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc. 
            </p>
            <img class="article-img resized"
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals/newspaper_small.jpg"
              alt="newspaper image"
              loading="lazy"
            />
            <p>
              Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p>
              In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a <code class="inline">&lt;p&gt;</code> element, 
              like so:
            </p>
            <code>
              &lt;p&gt;I am a paragraph, oh yes I am.&lt;/p&gt;
            </code>
            <p>
              Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element:
            </p>
            <code>
              &lt;h1&gt;I am the title of the story.&lt;/h1&gt;
            </code>
            <p>
              There are six heading elements â€” <code class="inline">&lt;h1&gt;</code>, 
              <code class="inline">&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code class="inline">&lt;h3&gt;</code>, 
              <code class="inline">&lt;h4&gt;</code>, <code class="inline">&lt;h5&gt;</code>, and 
              <code class="inline">&lt;h6&gt;</code>. Each element represents a different level of content in the 
              document; <code class="inline">&lt;h1&gt;</code> represents the main heading, 
              <code class="inline">&lt;h2&gt;</code> represents subheadings, <code class="inline">&lt;h1&gt;</code> 
              represents sub-subheadings, and so on.

              For example, in this story, the <code class="inline">&lt;h1&gt;</code> element represents the title
              of the story, the <code class="inline">&lt;h2&gt;</code> elements represent the title of each chapter,
              and the <code class="inline">&lt;h3&gt;</code> elements represent subsections of each chapter:

              <span class=new-line>&nbsp;&nbsp;Several more hours had passed, when all of a sudden the specter sat bolt
                upright and exclaimed, "Please have mercy on my soul!"</span>
              <span class=new-line>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
            </code>
            <p>
              It's really up to you what the elements involved represent, as long as the hierarchy makes sense. 
              You just need to bear in mind a few best practices as you create such structures:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Preferably, you should use a single <code class="inline">&lt;h1&gt;</code> per pageâ€”this is the 
                top level heading, and all others sit below this in the hierarchy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy. Don't use 
                <code class="inline">&lt;h3&gt;</code> elements to represent subheadings, followed by 
                <code class="inline">&lt;h2&gt;</code> elements to represent sub-subheadingsâ€”that doesn't make 
                sense and will lead to weird results.
              </li>
              <li>
                Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless 
                you feel it is necessary. Documents with many levels (for example, a deep heading hierarchy) 
                become unwieldy and difficult to navigate. On such occasions, it is advisable to spread the 
                content over multiple pages if possible.
              </li>

              To answer this question, let's take a look at the image belowâ€”the starting point of our running 
              example for this article (a nice hummus recipe). You should save a copy of this file on your

              This is because there are no elements to give the content structure, so the browser does not know 
              what is a heading and what is a paragraph. Furthermore:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Users looking at a web page tend to scan quickly to find relevant content, often just reading 
                the headings, to begin with. If they can't see anything useful within a few seconds, they'll 
                likely get frustrated and go somewhere else.
              </li>
              <li>
                Search engines indexing your page consider the contents of headings as important keywords for 
                influencing the page's search rankings. Without headings, your page will perform poorly in 
                terms of SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
              </li>
              <li>
                Severely visually impaired people often don't read web pages; they listen to them instead. 
                This is done with software called a screen reader. This software provides ways to get fast 
                access to given text content. Among the various techniques used, they provide an outline of the 
                document by reading out the headings, allowing their users to find the information they need 
                quickly. If headings are not available, they will be forced to listen to the whole document 
                read out loud.
              </li>
              <li>
                To style content with CSS, or make it do interesting things with JavaScript, you need to have 
                elements wrapping the relevant content, so CSS/JavaScript can effectively target it.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Therefore, we need to give our content structural markup.

              Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. They've been a feature of 
              the Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link 
              documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps 
              available at a web address. Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked 
              or otherwise activated the web browser goes to another web address (URL).

                and audio files, or anything else that lives on the Web. If the web browser doesn't know how to 
                display or handle the file, it will ask you if you want to open the file (in which case the duty 
                of opening or handling the file is passed to a suitable native app on the device) or download the 
                file (in which case you can try to deal with it later on).

              For example, the BBC homepage contains many links that point not only to multiple news stories, 
              but also different areas of the site (navigation functionality), login/registration pages 
              (user tools), and more.

          <header>Anatomy of a link</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an 
              <code class="inline">&lt;a&gt;</code> element and using the 
              <code class="inline">&lt;href&gt;</code> attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or 
              target, that contains the web address.
            </p>
            <code>
                <span class="new-line">&lt;p&gt;</span>
                <span class="new-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm creating a link to</span>
                <span class="new-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"&gt;the Mozilla homepage&lt;/a&gt;.</span>
                <span class="new-line">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
            </code>
            <p>
              This gives us the following result:
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm creating a link to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">the Mozilla homepage</a>.

        <section class="main-section" id="Block_level_links">
          <header>Block level links</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              As mentioned before, almost any content can be made into a link, even block-level elements. 
              If you want to make a heading element a link then wrap it in an anchor 
              (<code class="inline">&lt;a&gt;</code>) element as shown in the following code snippet: 
            </p>
            <code>
              <span class="new-line">&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"&gt;</span>
              <span class="new-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;MDN Web Docs&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
              <span class="new-line">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
            </code>
            <p>
              This turns the heading into a link:
            </p>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" 
              target="_blank"
            >
              <h1>MDN Web Docs</h1>

          <header>Image Links</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              If you have an image you want to make into a link, use the 
              <code class="inline">&lt;a&gt;</code> element to wrap the image file referenced with the 
              <code class="inline">&lt;img&gt;</code> element. The example below uses a relative path to 
              reference a locally stored SVG image file.
            </p>
            <code>
              <span class="new-line">&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"&gt;</span>
              <span class="new-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src="mdn_logo.svg" alt="MDN Web Docs" /&gt;</span>
              <span class="new-line">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
            </code>
            <p>
              This makes the MDN logo a link:

          <article>
            <p>
              Another attribute you may want to add to your links is title. The title contains additional 
              information about the link, such as which kind of information the page contains, or things to be 
              aware of on the website. 
            </p>
            <code>

            </code>
            <p>
              This gives us the following result and hovering over the link displays the title as a tooltip:

            There are many other elements in a HTML for formatting text, which we didn't get to in the 
            <a href="#HTML_text_fundamentals">HTML text fundamentals</a> article. The elements described in this 
            article are less known, but still useful to know about (and this is still not a complete list by any 
            means). Here you'll learn about marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and other 
            related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.

        <section class="main-section" id="Description_lists">
          <header>Description lists</header>
          <p>
            In <a href="#HTML_text_fundamentals">HTML text fundamentals</a>, we walked through how to mark up 
            basic lists in HTML, and we mentioned the third type of list you'll occasionally come across â€” 
            description lists. The purpose of these lists is to mark up a set of items and their associated 
            descriptions, such as terms and definitions, or questions and answers. Let's look at an example of 
            a set of terms and definitions:
          </p>
          <code>	
            <span class="new-line">soliloquy</span>
            <span class="new-line">In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their inner thoughts or feelings and in 
            the process relaying them to the audience (but not to other characters).</span>
            <span class="new-line">monologue</span>
            <span class="new-line">In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them with the audience and any other 
            characters present.</span>
            <span class="new-line">aside</span>
            <span class="new-line">In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for humorous or dramatic effect.</span>
            <span class="new-line">This is usually a feeling, thought or piece of additional background information</span>
          </code>
          <p>
            Description lists use a different wrapper than the other list types â€” 
            <code class="inline">&lt;dl&gt;</code>; in addition each term is wrapped in a 
            <code class="inline">&lt;dt&gt;</code> (description term) element, and each description is wrapped in a 
            <code class="inline">&lt;dd&gt;</code> (description definition) element. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's finish marking up our example:
          </p>
          <code>      	
            <span class="new-line">&lt;dl&gt;</span>
            <span class="new-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dt&gt;soliloquy&lt;/dt&gt;</span>
            <span class="new-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dd&gt;</span>
            <span class="new-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their inner 
              thoughts or feelings and in the process relaying them to the audience (but not to other 
              characters).</span>
            <span class="new-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/dd&gt;</span>
            <span class="new-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dt&gt;monologue&lt;/dt&gt;</span>
            <span class="new-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dd&gt;</span>
            <span class="new-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them with the 
              audience and any other characters present.</span>

            HTML also has features available for marking up quotations; which element you use depends on

            If a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) is quoted from
